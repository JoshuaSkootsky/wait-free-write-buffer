DEFINITION OF "DEPLOYMENT"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A "deployment" is defined as one (1) distinct Go application, service, 
or microservice that incorporates this library, regardless of the number 
of instances, replicas, or processes running concurrently.

Examples:
- A single microservice compiled into a binary that uses this library 
  counts as ONE deployment, even if you run 100 replicas in production.
- Three different microservices each using the library count as THREE 
  deployments.
- A CLI tool distributed to end-users counts as ONE deployment.
- A mobile or desktop application using the library counts as ONE 
  deployment per platform (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.).

EXCLUSIONS (do not count toward deployment limits):
- Development, testing, and CI/CD build environments
- Local developer workstations
- Staging, QA, or pre-production environments
- Short-lived feature branch deployments
